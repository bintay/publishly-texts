# Student Speech

This system is pretty cool. We can track similarity between the script and the speech, gesture frequency, filler words, and speech rate to streamline presentation preparation. Built with Vue, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Google Cloud, Flask, Node, Bulma, WebRTC, and Webkit Speech Recognition in twenty-four hours. I am a sophomore at Alcorn State University in Mississippi.
